Hardcoded to get its data from a spreadsheet on my Google Docs account.

Usage: To display the next word, press Enter. Exit with C-d.

Questions are color-coded by language because some words are ambiguous.
For example, the same word could mean different things in different languages.

Weighted randomization is presently hardcoded to favor words further down in
the spreadsheet because those are assumed to be more recently learned and in
more need of practice.

Language variable names can be made more generic if need be.
